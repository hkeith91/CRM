This project is an early attempt at what I would like to be my capstone project
in my portfolio when I begin to apply for backend or devops roles.  It is my 
attempt to challenge myself and push myself beyond being simply a beginner dev
and into a more intermediate level.

I was having some difficulty managing all these different tools and technologies
at the beginning of this project.  Although I've learned a lot from incorporating
Docker and CI into the project, upon reflection, I feel I was rushing ahead on a
shaky, weak foundation.  So I decided to step back and try to really understand 
each tool, beginning with Python itself.  I will try to implement this project's
Minimum Viable Product with Python alone, using files for persistence, and that
will live on it's own branch.  From there I will create another branch implementing
FastAPI into the project, which will itself live on its own branch. I will do the same
when adding a database, when adding an ORM and so on until all the layers are there.
This will give me a chance to practice some more advanced features of git, practice 
in refactoring my code, and a chance to examine and understand each layer and tool
that is apart of my  tech stack.
